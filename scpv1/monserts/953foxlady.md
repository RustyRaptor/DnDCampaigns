### **Traits**

**Shapechanger.** Vulpae can use her action to polymorph into any Medium or Small humanoid or beast, retaining her fox tail, vulpine ears, and fur. Her stats remain the same regardless of form. Equipment does not change.

**Psionic Influence.** Vulpae can innately cast the following spells without components, using Charisma as her spellcasting ability (save DC 16):

- At will: _Minor Illusion_, _Detect Thoughts_, _Suggestion_
- 3/day each: _Hold Person_, _Phantasmal Killer_
- 1/day: _Dominate Person_

**Playful Predator.** If a creature fails a saving throw against one of Vulpae’s charm or suggestion effects, she gains advantage on her next attack or spell against that creature.

**Foxfire Glamour.** As a bonus action, Vulpae can emit a shimmering aura of illusion and allure. Each creature of her choice within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of her next turn.

**Tail Whip (Psychic).** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
_Hit:_ 10 (2d4 + 5) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Eviscerate (Recharge 5–6).** Vulpae targets one creature she has charmed, stunned, or paralyzed. She attempts a precise, deadly strike.  
_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
