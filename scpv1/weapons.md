SCP-6952-1: High-Velocity Blade

Weapon Type: Exotic Melee Weapon (Requires Proficiency)
Category: Very Rare Anomalous Weapon
Damage: 2d10 slashing damage
Weight: 6 lbs
Properties: Versatile (2d12), Finesse, Special, Requires Attunement

Description:

The High-Velocity Blade is an advanced bladed weapon, designed using anomalous technology to vibrate at an extraordinary frequency of 10,000 Hertz. This vibration, driven by an Ultrasonic Vibration Generator, allows the blade to slice through nearly any material by weakening the molecular bonds of its target. Foundation personnel have fitted the blade with a vibration-proof handle to ensure the user’s safety and comfort during use.

This weapon combines a High Carbon-Adamantine alloy with the ultrasonic vibration generator, resulting in a blade that can cut through almost anything with ease. However, it should be noted that while the blade is highly effective against most materials, it's not capable of cutting through exceptionally thick or reinforced structures in a single strike.

Special Properties:

    Vibration Cut: When activated, the blade vibrates at 10,000 Hertz, allowing it to ignore resistance to slashing damage and deal an additional 1d6 force damage on a hit. The vibration can be activated or deactivated as a bonus action.

    Versatile Cutting Power: The High-Velocity Blade is versatile, allowing it to be wielded in one hand (dealing 2d10 damage) or two hands (dealing 2d12 damage). Despite its immense cutting power, it cannot cut through materials that are magically reinforced or of exceptional density (such as adamantine, dragon scales, or mythril) without multiple strikes.

    UV Generator: The Ultrasonic Vibration Generator (UV Generator) powering the blade requires a charge of 48 hours for 48 hours of continuous use. After 48 hours of use, the blade’s vibration effect becomes inactive until recharged.

    Cut Anything… Almost: The blade’s cutting power is nearly unparalleled, but it has its limits. While it can slice through most materials with ease, it cannot instantly sever objects like tanks or mechs in half. Attempting such feats will only produce sparks, a bit of smoke, and maybe a very confused opponent. “You can’t cut a tank or a mech in half with this thing. That would be ridiculous.” - Researcher Johnston

    The High-Velocity Blade, while incredibly powerful, is not capable of the over-the-top feats seen in certain video games. While wielding it, you might feel a sudden urge to yell, “Rules of Nature!” as you slice through your enemies, but remember: you’re still bound by the rules of physics. Cutting a tank or mech in half in one swing? That's a bit too high-tech.

        ---

        **Description:**

        The Gauss Rifle is a powerful ballistic weapon utilizing advanced anomalous technology. Shaped like a conventional assault rifle, it uses a series of superconducting coils made from Coronal Ferrite to accelerate tungsten projectiles to supersonic speeds. The weapon's unique design compensates for the intense recoil, making it surprisingly easy to control despite its power.

        The Gauss Rifle is equipped with a magnetic shield around the magazine, preventing the weapon from tearing itself apart when fired. It is also compatible with an underbarrel 38mm laser-guided HEAT rocket for additional firepower. This weapon is highly effective against heavily armored targets and can punch through even the toughest defenses.

        ---

        **Special Properties:**

        - **Firing Modes:**
        - **Full Auto:** As an action, you can fire a continuous stream of projectiles. Make a ranged attack roll against any number of creatures within a 20-foot cone, starting with those closest to you. Each creature hit takes 3d10 piercing damage. The magazine is depleted by 10 rounds for each attack made in this mode.
        - **3-Round Burst:** As an action, make three attack rolls against a single target within range. Each hit deals 3d10 piercing damage. The magazine is depleted by 3 rounds for each attack made in this mode.
        - **Single Fire:** As an action, make one ranged attack roll against a single target within range. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 piercing damage.

        - **Recoil Dampening:** The Gauss Rifle has been equipped with advanced kinetic dampeners, reducing the recoil of each shot. You do not suffer disadvantage on attack rolls made in Full Auto or 3-Round Burst modes, even if you do not have proficiency with this weapon.

        - **Coronal Ferrite Superconductors:** The weapon does not overheat and can fire continuously without risk of malfunction due to heat. It also deals an additional 1d6 force damage on a critical hit.

        - **HEAT Rocket (Optional):** If equipped, you can use an action to fire the underbarrel 38mm laser-guided HEAT rocket. The rocket has a range of 150/600 ft., and on a hit, it deals 4d10 fire damage and 4d10 force damage in a 10-foot radius explosion. This attack consumes one use of the HEAT rocket. Reloading the rocket requires an action.

        - **Limited Ammunition:** The Gauss Rifle has a 50-round magazine, and each attack mode consumes a specific number of rounds. Once the magazine is depleted, it requires an action to reload with a fresh magazine. The weapon’s battery provides power for up to 800 shots before it must be replaced or recharged.

        - **Anomalous Power Source:** The weapon's battery is an advanced anomalous power cell. It does not generate heat, and the weapon can function in extreme conditions without degradation in performance.

        ---

        **Attunement:** 

        - The Gauss Rifle requires attunement by a character with proficiency in exotic ranged weapons or firearms. Attuning to the weapon grants the user an innate understanding of its complex mechanics and firing modes.

        - **Alignment Restriction:** The weapon's anomalous nature is tied to the intent of its user. It cannot be attuned by creatures with an evil alignment.


### **SCP-6952-1: Hephaestus-Grade Armor**

**Armor Type:** Heavy Armor (Requires Proficiency)  
**Category:** Very Rare Anomalous Armor  
**Armor Class (AC):** 20 (Plate)  
**Weight:** 40 lbs (with exoskeleton); 65 lbs (without exoskeleton)  
**Properties:** Bulky, Requires Attunement

---

**Description:**

The Hephaestus-Grade Armor is an advanced set of heavy armor designed using the anomalous properties of Adamantite, a metal with similar properties to graphene but with significantly greater strength and durability. This armor offers near-invulnerability to conventional weapons, providing unparalleled protection on the battlefield.

The armor consists of bullet-resistant plates, reinforced helmets, and a full-body suit capable of withstanding the most punishing attacks. In situations where the weight of the armor would typically hinder movement, a powered exoskeleton has been integrated into the design, allowing the wearer to maintain mobility while fully protected.

---

**Special Properties:**

- **Adamantite Reinforcement:** The Hephaestus-Grade Armor is made from Boron Adamantide, a super-dense and highly conductive material that provides exceptional protection against physical and energy-based attacks. The armor grants resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as resistance to fire damage.

- **Neutron Absorption:** The armor has increased neutron absorption capabilities, offering resistance to radiant damage and protection against neutron-based attacks.

- **Powered Exoskeleton:** The exoskeleton integrated into the armor provides enhanced mobility and reduces the encumbrance typically associated with heavy armor. When worn with the exoskeleton, the armor's weight is reduced to 40 lbs, and the wearer does not suffer from disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Without the exoskeleton, the armor's weight is 65 lbs, and the wearer suffers disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

- **Hephaestus Durability:** The armor is nearly indestructible by conventional means. It can only be damaged or destroyed by anomalous or magical effects. The armor has 150 hit points, and if it is reduced to 0 hit points, it becomes unusable until repaired by someone proficient in working with exotic materials.

- **Attunement Requirement:** The Hephaestus-Grade Armor requires attunement by a character with proficiency in heavy armor. Attuning to the armor grants the wearer an innate understanding of its advanced systems and the ability to operate the powered exoskeleton effectively.

- **Bulky:** The armor is considered bulky, requiring specialized training or feats to wear effectively. The wearer must have a Strength score of at least 18 to wear the armor without penalty. If the wearer’s Strength is below 18, they suffer a -2 penalty to their AC while wearing the armor.

**Researcher’s Notes:**

“No metal is indestructible, and neither is body armor. But what we've dubbed 'Hephaestus Grade' is easily one of the largest leaps in armor technology we have for our MTF. While anomalous means are required to destroy it, we've had a bit of fun trying the old conventional ways of trying to dent a Hephaestus plate.” - Researcher Johnston

When using the exoskeleton "Red Sun" plays in the background. Additionally the player will feel the urge to say "IM FUCKING INVINCIBLE" when activating the exoskeleton.
