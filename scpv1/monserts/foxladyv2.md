## Abilities

### Polymorphic Form

* As a bonus action, 953 can shift between **Human Form** (charisma-focused) and **Fox Form** (dexterity-focused).
* Gains temporary benefits depending on form:

  * **Human:** +4 to Charisma checks, gains *Charm* abilities.
  * **Fox:** +2 AC, +20 ft. movement, multiattack claws.

### **Horrific Charm (Recharge 5‚Äì6)**

* Each creature of 953‚Äôs choice within 30 ft. must succeed on a **DC 16 Wisdom save** or be **Charmed for 1 minute**.
* While Charmed, the target regards 953 as a trusted companion.
* Each time 953 or her allies harm the target, it may repeat the save with advantage.
* On a natural 1, the charmed victim may be compelled to **harm another ally** under suggestion.

### **Telepathic Deception**

* As an action, 953 can implant an illusion in a creature‚Äôs mind (DC 15 Intelligence save). On a failure, the creature perceives a false reality (e.g., their ally looks like a monster, 953 appears innocent, the room is empty). Lasts 1 minute or until concentration breaks.

### **Liver Strike (Fox form, melee attack)**

* Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
* Hit: 2d8+4 piercing + target must succeed DC 15 Constitution save or suffer **ongoing bleeding** (1d6 damage per turn until healed).

### **Multiattack**

* In Human form: 2 claw strikes (1d8+4 each).
* In Fox form: 3 claw strikes (1d8+4 each).

### **Legendary Actions (2/round)**

* **Illusion Step (Cost 1):** Teleports up to 30 ft. to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving behind an illusory double that lasts until the start of her next turn.
* **Foxfire (Cost 2):** Launches a burning psychic flame at one target within 60 ft. (2d10 psychic damage, DC 15 Wisdom save for half).

## Encounter Phases

**Phase 1: Seduction & Control**

* Begins in **human form**, using Horrific Charm and Telepathic Deception to turn allies against each other.
* Will feign weakness and lure PCs into range.

**Phase 2: Predatory Fox**

* Once reduced to 50% HP, she shifts into **fox form** ‚Äî faster, deadlier, claws tearing livers.
* Starts focusing down a single target at a time.

**Phase 3: Nine Tails Unleashed** *(optional if you want extreme challenge)*

* At 25% HP, she erupts with **Foxfire**, gaining an aura of psychic flame (10 ft. radius, 1d6 psychic per turn).
* Legendary actions escalate (now 3 per round).

---

## Environmental Features

* **The Kennels**: If players thought to bring or release dogs from nearby kennels, 953 will panic ‚Äî disadvantage on attack rolls, and her Charm ability is suppressed.
* **Mirror Illusions**: The room may fracture with illusory duplicates of 953 ‚Äî requiring Insight checks to spot the real one.
* **Victims‚Äô Echoes**: Whispers of past prey (flavor for failed Wis saves).

---

## Tactics

* Opens with **Horrific Charm** to split the party.
* Tries to isolate the weakest target and go for the **Liver Strike** kill.
* Retreats with **Illusion Step** if surrounded.
* If cornered, unleashes **Foxfire** to punish clustered PCs.

This makes her feel **seductive, cruel, and inhumanly cunning**, matching her SCP lore ‚Äî while still staying within a balanced CR \~9 range for a level 5 party.

Do you want me to also build a **‚ÄúCharm Subtable‚Äù** (weird compulsions she implants ‚Äî e.g. eat dirt, attack ally, confess love) to make her psychic powers more flavorful during combat?
