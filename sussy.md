1. We gathered images and sensor data from buildings at marshall space flight center and leveraged modern AI tools to create software that can efficiently detect issues and predict system failures before they become a mission obstacle. 
2. Using YOLOv8 for visual inspection we were able to detect corrosion, leaks, cracks, and foreign objects in real time with high reliability.
3. Rich sensor data from chiller systems and electrical systems at MSFC allowed us to build models that can predict system failures up to 60 days ahead with over 85 percent accuracy.
4. Proving out this software shows great promise to bring an AI powered workflow for automating inspection and fixing mission critical subsystems before they cause downtime.
