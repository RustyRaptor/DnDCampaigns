# ❄️ SCP-244-Inspired Encounter: Frozen Veil Lair

## **Lair Name:** The Frozen Veil  
**Location Type:** Abandoned Cold Storage Complex / Deep Cavernous Facility  
**Environment:** Sub-zero, fog-choked interiors with constantly dropping temperatures. Visibility is severely limited due to supernatural ice fog.

---

## **Environmental Effects**

- **Temperature:** Constantly at **-37°C**, increasing over time as fog density grows.  
- **Humidity:** 125%, causing frost buildup and slick terrain.  
- **Visibility:** Obscured beyond 10 ft. due to thick fog.  
- **Movement:** Non-magical movement is halved due to slippery surfaces and low visibility.

## **Core Threats**

**Creature Type:** Elemental (Cold, Mist)  
**Size:** Small  
**Alignment:** Unaligned  

#### **Stat Highlights**
- **HP:** 24 (6d6 + 6)  
- **AC:** 14  
- **Speed:** 0 ft. (Hover 40 ft.)

#### **Vulnerabilities:** Fire  
#### **Condition Immunities:** Prone, Grappled, Restrained, Exhaustion  

#### **Abilities**
- **Thermal Lure:** Frost Wisps passively detect heat sources within 60 ft. They prioritize movement toward and surrounding warm creatures or objects.
- **Flash Freeze (Recharge 5–6):** Creatures within 5 ft. must succeed a DC 13 CON save or take **3d6 cold damage** and become **frozen (restrained)** for 1 turn. Success: Half damage, no restraint.
- **Heat Drain:** Contact with a living creature siphons warmth. Target must succeed a DC 12 CON save or take 1 level of **exhaustion** (once per creature per long rest).

---

## **Lair Actions (Initiative Count 20)**

- **Chill Pulse:** A wave of supernatural cold surges through the lair. All creatures without cold resistance must make a **DC 14 CON save** or take **2d6 cold damage** and have their movement halved until the end of their next turn.
- **Ice Bloom:** Sheets of frost erupt across surfaces. Designate 3 locations within 60 ft. as difficult terrain and require a **DC 13 DEX save** to avoid falling prone.
- **Wisp Spawn:** A Frost Wisp coalesces near a warm object or player if the temperature has remained below -37°C for more than 3 rounds.

---

## **Optional Lair Boss: Cryovessel (The Jar Itself)**

**Type:** Magical Construct / Artifact  
**AC:** 18 (Arcane Reinforced Ceramic)  
**HP:** 120  
**Special:** Regenerates 10 HP/round if not exposed to a heat source of 600°C or more.  
**Ability – Endless Fog:** Continues to emit supernatural mist, increasing Fog Density every round. Once Fog Density reaches 5, Frost Wisps double in speed and gain resistance to magical fire.

---

## **Tactics and Strategy**

- Wisps are silent and unseen in dense fog, striking from nowhere.
- Players must use heat to push back or reveal the mist creatures.
- Environmental hazards and creeping cold make endurance a key challenge.
- Destroying or sealing the Cryovessel is the only permanent way to end the fog.

## **Traits**

### ❄️ **Mist Cloak**
While in fog or heavily obscured terrain, the Frost Reaper has **advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks** and attacks against it are made with **disadvantage**.

### 🧊 **Cold Core**
When struck by fire damage, the Reaper loses its Mist Cloak trait until the start of its next turn.

### 🕯️ **Frozen Aura**
At the start of each of the Frost Reaper's turns, all creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a **DC 14 Constitution saving throw** or take **5 (1d10) cold damage** and have their speed halved until the end of their next turn.

---

## **Actions**

### 🗡️ **Ice Reaver Blade** *(Melee Weapon Attack)*  
+6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
**Hit:** 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing + 7 (2d6) cold damage.  
If the target is wearing metal armor, it has disadvantage on the saving throw from Frozen Aura next turn.

---

### 🌬️ **Frigid Pulse** *(Recharge 5–6)*  
The Reaper slams the ground, releasing a burst of freezing fog in a 15-foot radius.  
Each creature in the area must make a **DC 15 Constitution saving throw**, taking **27 (6d8) cold damage** on a failure, or half as much on a success.  
Creatures who fail are also **blinded** by mist until the end of their next turn.

---

## **Bonus Action**

### 👁️ **Mist Step** *(Recharge 4–6)*  
The Reaper teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see within the fog. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.

---

## **Tactics**

- **Stalks through the fog**, closing the distance with Mist Step to isolate targets.
- **Punishes grouped players** with Frigid Pulse.
- **Preys on the weak and warm**, favoring those who use fire or radiate heat.
- Often coordinated with Frost Wisps, acting as a fog-bound enforcer.
