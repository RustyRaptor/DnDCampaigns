## SCP-2396's Sleep Inducement Mechanic

**Effect Description:**
When a male-identified character comes within a certain range of SCP-2396 (e.g., 30 feet), they become susceptible to a magical sleep effect. This effect gradually overcomes them unless they can resist it through willpower and mental fortitude.

**Saving Throw Mechanism:**

1. **Initial Exposure:** Upon first coming within range of SCP-2396, male-identified characters must make a Wisdom saving throw. The Difficulty Class (DC) for this saving throw can be set based on how challenging you want the encounter to be (for example, DC 13).

2. **Progression of Effect:**

   - **Round 1:** On a failed save, the character begins to feel drowsy but suffers no immediate effects.
   - **Round 2:** If within range, the character must make another Wisdom saving throw. On a second consecutive failed save, they suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks due to increased drowsiness.
   - **Round 3:** The character must make a third Wisdom saving throw. Failing this save results in the character falling into a magical sleep for a certain duration (e.g., 1 minute) or until they are awoken by an ally or another external force.

3. **Recovery:** A character who successfully makes any of the saving throws is immune to SCP-2396's sleep-inducing effect for the next 24 hours.

4. **Countermeasures:** Characters might seek ways to counteract the effect, such as using spells that protect against charm or sleep, consuming certain potions, or employing magical items.

5. **Roleplay Opportunity:** The gradual onset of drowsiness provides an opportunity for roleplay. Characters can describe their increasing struggle to stay awake, adding to the encounter's narrative depth.
