# SCP v1 Notes
#### Players and Creatures
In this first iteration I will avoid making any changes to core DnD. The player characters will appear in the SCP universe through some kind of portal or event.
The creatures and bosses in the SCP world will have stat blocks from existing DnD creatures but with minor changes in appearance, behaviour, and abilities to match their character. 

Since there are portals that exist to the DnD universe I can even pull other creatures and bosses from DnD if needed to fill in the gaps.

#### Map
To avoid getting too ambitious ~~I will limit the map to a single SCP Foundation site.~~ I will limit the map to a fixed chain of sites with fixed access points between them. In future iterations I would like to expand the world to have many sites and locations of interest that are openly accessible. 

#### Gameplay
The goal and progression of the campaign will be based on getting from point A to point B. Point A being the portal or anomaly the players emerged from. Point B is another anomaly which has the capacity to get the players back home. 

Along the way there will be many challenges and puzzles the players need to overcome in order to get to their destination. Many things can go wrong even to the point of causing world ending scenarios. 

#### Terminals
There will be terminals in spots around the map that contain useful information about the map and creatures they can find. A player can make an intelligence check to access a terminal. There will be a threshold minimum to gain access and the higher the player rolls the more information they can obtain. 

- A nat 20 for example could even give them direct clues to the "Point B".
- A nat 1 might raise an alarm or accidentally cause a breach in containment or nothing at the DMs choice. 

when information is unlocked I will provide a mixture of personal notes as well as direct links to SCP articles. Players are required to read them on their own. This provides an excellent chance for the DM and other players who don't wanna read to go get some coffee and popcorn. Players who are avid fans of SCP will find these easy to navigate. 

#### Combat

I will avoid making any changes to the combat mechanics. However I will add some things in order to make interacting with certain SCPs interesting. 

- There will be special emphasis on how the player uses their senses and positions themselves. 
- Which way the character faces. 
- Opening eyes/closing eyes
- covering ears

All these will come into play in the combat but core DnD mechanics will be untouched. 

#### Dimensions and planes

If there is a dimension in the SCP universe and the player's character has the information about said dimensions they are welcome to use a DnD spell to access said dimension at the DM's discretion of course. 


## Brain Storming Section
Just a place to jot down ideas. Nothing necessarily needs to leave this section. 

##### Mapping Info
- Area vs Site
- On-site nuclear warheads
  - Nat 1 on terminal sometimes?
  - Give warning to players before they roll
- Sectors and Units
  - Sectors are sections of the site categorized by purpose.
  - Units are self contained sections containing special anomalies with higher secutity and isolation. 
- Prefixes for sites and areas
  - Armed
    - High secutity section
  - Biological (Bio)
    - Biohazard containments
  - Containment
    - duh
  - Dimension (Dim)
    - Contains extradimensional things
  - Humanoid
    - Duh
  - Protected
    - No anomalous influence. Kind of a safe zone to keep away from anomalies. might have some special protection
  - Provisional
    - Not pre built but rather built around an anomaly that can't be relocated. 
  - Reliquary
    - Kind of a museum or safehold for sensitive artifacts. 
  - Research
    - duh
  - Storage
    - duh

List of facilities (partial):
There's a countless lot of facilities to pick from these are the most common ones we will likely pick from here. 

- Site-01
  - Classified safe zone for 05 council and data backup
  - No Anomalies (except the 05 council themselves of course)
  - Likely wont be involved this iteration.
- Site-06-3
  - Lorraine, France
  - Use to be in the US then Germany before here
  - Low risk human and humanoid SCPs
  - This could be great for an easy first campaign but might not be as interesting.
  - This might be useful as a stopping point between sites where the players meet an SCP that joins their journey or helps them in some way. 
  - Putting on hold for now as having a more core site is more important. 
- Site 19
  - Largest facility in operation
  - Lansing, Michigan
  - So far looks like it would make an excellent starting location and maybe works as a standalone map due to its size.
  - Ok this is absoltely going to be the first campaign lets get started.

##### Guide characters
It might be a good idea to add in some kind of side NPC character be it an anomaly or employee that follows the players and helps guide them through the world. 

##### Storage Sectors
- Storage rooms are secured rooms which contain useful items, information, and sometimes SCPs. 
- Result of opening one is always positive or neutral. 
- Storage rooms can be locked by terminals of varying difficulties or not be locked at DM's choice.


##### Mobile Terminals
- This could be a powerful late-game item basically a "pokedex for SCPs"
- Can be used to quickly make intelligence rolls to learn more about a creature or anomaly.
