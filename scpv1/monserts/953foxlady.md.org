:CUSTOM_ID: traits
:END:
*Shapechanger.* Vulpae can use her action to polymorph into any Medium
or Small humanoid or beast, retaining her fox tail, vulpine ears, and
fur. Her stats remain the same regardless of form. Equipment does not
change.

*Psionic Influence.* Vulpae can innately cast the following spells
without components, using Charisma as her spellcasting ability (save DC
16):

- At will: /Minor Illusion/, /Detect Thoughts/, /Suggestion/
- 3/day each: /Hold Person/, /Phantasmal Killer/
- 1/day: /Dominate Person/

*Playful Predator.* If a creature fails a saving throw against one of
Vulpae's charm or suggestion effects, she gains advantage on her next
attack or spell against that creature.

*Foxfire Glamour.* As a bonus action, Vulpae can emit a shimmering aura
of illusion and allure. Each creature of her choice within 10 feet must
succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of
her next turn.
