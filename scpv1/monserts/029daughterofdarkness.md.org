--------------

*Anomalous Properties (Dark Influence):*\\
SCP-029 exerts a powerful influence over male characters. Any male
character who starts their turn within line of sight of SCP-029 must
make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or become charmed by her. Charmed
creatures will protect SCP-029 and are compelled to follow her commands.
This effect lasts until the creature is no longer within line of sight
of SCP-029.

*Strangulation Mastery:*\\
SCP-029 can use any object as a weapon to grapple and strangle her
opponents. Her attacks never shed blood but instead aim to subdue and
strangle her victims.

- *Unarmed Strike:* /Melee Weapon Attack:/ +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
  target. /Hit:/ The target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this
  grapple ends, the target is restrained, and SCP-029 can't use this
  attack on another target.

- *Improvised Weapon (Strangulation):* /Melee Weapon Attack:/ +13 to
  hit, reach 10 ft., one target. /Hit:/ The target is grappled (escape
  DC 24). SCP-029 has advantage on this attack if she is holding an
  object to use as a strangulation weapon (e.g., rope, chain, cloth).

*Lair Action:*\\
At the start of her turn, SCP-029 can use a lair action to make the
lights in her lair flicker or dim. All creatures within the lair must
succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be affected as if by the
/blindness/deafness/ spell (blindness only) until the start of their
next turn.

*Shadow Meld:*\\
SCP-029 can meld with the shadows, becoming invisible in areas of dim
light or darkness. As a bonus action, she can hide in any area of
darkness, and she cannot be detected by non-magical means.
